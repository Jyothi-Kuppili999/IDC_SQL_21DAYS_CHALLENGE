I had the opportunity to attend an insightful **Knowledge session** by **Indian Data Club (IDC)** as part of the **21 Days SQL Challenge — “Working with SQL Effectively”** 
featuring Toni Ramchandani (Author & AI Researcher) and hosted by Kratika Jain and Sahib Musharraf 

💡 Key takeaways from the session:
🔹 Learned about the history and evolution of SQL, dating back to the early 1970s, and how it continues to shape modern data management.
🔹 Understood how SQL remains the backbone of leading data platforms like Redshift and Snowflake.
🔹 The concept of discipline and compounding shared by Toni Ramchandani was truly impactful — reminding us that consistent effort compounds over time, just like data-driven growth in organizations.

🏆 Quiz Highlight:
Wrapped up the session with an interactive quiz and I’m glad to share that I secured the 4th position out of 165 participants! 🎉
A fun and competitive way to reinforce the learning. 💪

📈 This session not only enhanced my technical understanding of SQL but also reinforced the importance of continuous learning and disciplined practice.
