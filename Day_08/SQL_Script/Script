### Practice Questions:

-- 1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(name) as PATIENT_NAME
FROM patients;
-- 2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
SELECT distinct staff_name,LENGTH(staff_name) as name_length
from staff_schedule;

-- 3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
SELECT distinct staff_id,staff_name,CONCAT(staff_id,' - ',staff_name) as staff_info
from staff_schedule

### Daily Challenge:

-- **Question:** Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), 
-- and name length. Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.
SELECT patient_id,
       UPPER(name) as PATIENT_NAME,
       LOWER(service) as Service,
       CASE
       WHEN age >= 65 then 'Senior' 
       WHEN age >= 18 then 'Adult' 
       ELSE 'Minor'
       END as Age_group,
       LENGTH(name) as name_length
FROM patients
where LENGTH(name)>10;
